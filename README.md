Minnesota Native Plant Community Classification System objects for RMAVIS  

Deviations from RMAVIS default objects:  
- taxon names in floristic tables include height strata (understory, sub-canopy, canopy) for tree species  
- cover in floristic tables is the approximate midpoint of the Braun-Blanquet scale (TÃ¼xen and Ellenberg 1937, as presented in Table 1 of McNellie et al. 2019)  
- accepted taxa and the taxa look-up table are based on [MNTaxa](https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/eco/mbs/plant-lists.html)
